# A perfect ChatGPT Companion 

## Introduction

Introducing a new plugin for ChatGPT that makes it easy to copy answers and get a quick count of the number of words and characters in the response. With this plugin, users can simply click a "Copy" button to copy the entire answer to their clipboard with a single click.

Additionally, the plugin provides a real-time count of the number of words and characters in the answer, which can be helpful for users who are trying to stay within a certain character limit or simply want to know how long the response is.

This plugin is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with a clean and simple interface that integrates seamlessly into the ChatGPT platform. Whether you're a student, professional, or just someone who wants to get the most out of ChatGPT, this plugin is a must-have for anyone who wants to copy answers with ease and get a quick word and character count.
